# Password-Strength
Password Strength checking app

A basic C# windows forms application that takes an input and checks the strength of the password.
First C# project - made in Visual Studio 2019 Community.

Uses basic parameters to determine strength and gives visual and text based response.
Has buttons which closes the app, initiates the check, and resets the input.
Simple but aesthetic UI with custom logo.

Available as both a .cs file and as a .exe - .exe is in the bin file

# What I learnt
